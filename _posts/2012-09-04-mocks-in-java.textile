"Mock objects":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object are simulated objects that mimic the behavior of real objects in controlled ways.

"Mockito":http://code.google.com/p/mockito/ is my favourite mocking framework for Java for writing mock objects usable by unit tests.

Here is an example:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/3619937.js?file=gistfile1.java"></script>

But sometimes you need to mock something which Mockito can't handle.

"PowerMock":http://code.google.com/p/powermock/ is an extension to Mocking frameworks like Mockito. It extends these frameworks to mock things like static methods or constructors.

The PowerMock website has a good page explaining "how to use PowerMock with Mockito":http://code.google.com/p/powermock/wiki/MockitoUsage13 .
