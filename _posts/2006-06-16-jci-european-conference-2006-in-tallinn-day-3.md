Very interesting key note from Alexander Bard in the morning about
social development of society from feudalism to capitalism and now to
informationalism which he described in his book "Netocrats". It is
difficult to describe his descriptions in a short way but it was very
convincing. He watches finnish and corean schoolgirls what they do with
their electronic gadgets for predicting new communication trends. The
new value in the netocracy is the attention. The attention economy is
based on awareness multiplied by credibility. Money follows attention.
