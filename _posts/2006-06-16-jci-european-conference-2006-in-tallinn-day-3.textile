Very interesting key note from Alexander Bard in the morning about social development of society from feudalism to capitalism and now to informationalism which he described in his book "Netocrats". It is difficult to describe his descriptions in a short way but it was very convincing. He watches finnish and corean schoolgirls what they do with their electronic gadgets for predicting new communication trends. The new value in the netocracy is the attention. The attention economy is based on awareness multiplied by credibility. Money follows attention.
