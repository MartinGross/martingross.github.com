"Wicket":http://wicket.sourceforge.net/ ist ein relativ neues Web-Framework, das einen interessanten Ansatz verfolgt:

bq. ??Wicket is a Java web application framework that takes simplicity, separation of concerns and ease of development to a whole new level. Wicket pages can be mocked up, previewed and later revised using standard WYSIWYG HTML design tools. Dynamic content processing and form handling is all handled in Java code using a first-class component model backed by POJO data beans that can easily be persisted using your favourite technology.??

bq. ??Swing-like OO Component Model: Pages and Components in Wicket are real Java objects that support encapsulation, inheritance and events.??

bq. ??Ease of Development: Because Wicket is Java and HTML, you can leverage what you know about Java or your favorite HTML editor to write Wicket applications.??

bq. ??Separation of Concerns: Wicket does not mix markup with Java code and adds no special syntax to your markup files. The worlds of HTML and Java are parallel and associated only by Wicket ids, which are attributes in HTML and Component properties in Java. Since Wicket HTML is just HTML and Wicket Java is just Java, coders and designers can work independently to a large degree and without relying on any special tools.??

Zur Zeit liegt ein "Proposal":http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/WicketProposal vor, dass vorschlÃ¤gt Wicket als Apache Projekt zu etablieren.
