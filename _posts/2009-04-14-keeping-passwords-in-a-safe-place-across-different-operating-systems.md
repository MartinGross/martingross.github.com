From the [KeePass project website](http://keepass.info/) :

> "KeePass is a free open source password manager, which helps you to
> manage your passwords in a secure way. You can put all your passwords
> in one database, which is locked with one master key or a key file. So
> you only have to remember one single master password or select the key
> file to unlock the whole database. The databases are encrypted using
> the best and most secure encryption algorithms currently known (AES
> and Twofish)."

Keepass is a very nice tool for windows. But as I am working more and
more on other platforms using different operating systems (i.e. WinXP
and Mac OSX) I had o find a solution to access all passwords there. BTW:
OSX Keychain is a nice tool but it can't be used on Windows.

As KeePass is a open source software I was glad to discover that KeePass
is available in a Linux/OSX version as well a.k.a.
[KeePassX](http://keepassx.sourceforge.net/) . Database formats are the
same. Which means you can use the same database file on all plattforms.
Perfect!
