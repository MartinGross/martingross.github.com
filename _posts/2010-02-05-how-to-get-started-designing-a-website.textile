h2. Layout

Brainstorm some ideas on paper. I prefer to start just in black and white. Colors can be distracting when trying to create the "perfect" layout.

Then use a grid system like "960 Grid System":http://960.gs/ or "Blueprint CSS":http://blueprintcss.org/ . Some call them CSS frameworks.

h2. Colors

Use a color generator e.g. "colorschemedesigner.com":http://colorschemedesigner.com/ and "kuler.adobe.com":http://kuler.adobe.com/ and then pick colors from the theme.


h2. Typography

A practical guide to web typography is: "webtypography.net":http://webtypography.net/

Or use something like "typography.css"::http://blueprintcss.org/blueprint/src/typography.css from "Blueprint CSS":http://blueprintcss.org/
