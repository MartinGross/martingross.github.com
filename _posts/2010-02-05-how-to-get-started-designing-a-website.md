## Layout

Brainstorm some ideas on paper. I prefer to start just in black and
white. Colors can be distracting when trying to create the "perfect"
layout.

Then use a grid system like [960 Grid System](http://960.gs/) or
[Blueprint CSS](http://blueprintcss.org/) . Some call them CSS
frameworks.

## Colors

Use a color generator e.g.
[colorschemedesigner.com](http://colorschemedesigner.com/) and
[kuler.adobe.com](http://kuler.adobe.com/) and then pick colors from the
theme.

## Typography

A practical guide to web typography is:
[webtypography.net](http://webtypography.net/)

Or use something like
[typography.css](:http://blueprintcss.org/blueprint/src/typography.css)
from [Blueprint CSS](http://blueprintcss.org/)
