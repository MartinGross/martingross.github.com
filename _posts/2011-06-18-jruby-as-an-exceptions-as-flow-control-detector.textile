Chris Heald shows in his "article 'JRuby Performance: Exceptions are not flow control'":http://www.coffeepowered.net/2011/06/17/jruby-performance-exceptions-are-not-flow-control/ how the anti-pattern of using 'exceptions as flow control' has an serious effect on the performance.

Thanks to "headius":http://twitter.com/#!/headius logging the exceptions is as easy as:

@jruby -Xlog.exceptions=true -Xlog.backtraces=true -Xlog.callers=true -S trinidad 2>&1 | grep "Backtrace generated" -A4@

BTW: "trinidad":https://github.com/trinidad/trinidad is used to run rails and rackup applications in an embedded Apache Tomcat
