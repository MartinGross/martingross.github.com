There are a lot of reasons to use "git instead of svn":http:// . But it is hard to switch to a new version control system in a running project.

"git-svn is a alternative":http:// if you would like to use git with an existing subversion repository. Unfortunately <code>git svn clone</code> is "dog slow on windows":http://osdir.com/ml/version-control.msysgit/2008-05/msg00112.html . And I mean really slow. It would have taken more than 10 hours to clone an existing project from the subversion repository. As this wasn't an option I decided to do something which might be useful for other purposes, too.

The unconventional solution:
Run git-svn on Linux in virtual machine on Windows and copy it the complete directory to windows.


Install VirtualBox
http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

Download Ubuntu Image and unpack
VirtualBoxes has some "ubuntu images ready to run":http://virtualboxes.org/images/ubuntu/. 

Configure Ubuntu VM in Virtualbox

Start Ubuntu

Configure shared folders
<code>
# sudo mkdir /media/windows-share

# sudo mount -t vboxsf folder-name /media/windows-share
</code>

Mount shared folder

Install git-core

Install git-svn

run git svn clone

copy directory to shared folder
