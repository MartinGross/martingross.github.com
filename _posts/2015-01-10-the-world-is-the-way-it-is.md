> „When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and you're life is just to live your life inside  the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money.  That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you.  And you can change it, you can influence it… Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.“
