[Wicket](http://wicket.sourceforge.net/) ist ein relativ neues
Web-Framework, das einen interessanten Ansatz verfolgt:

> Wicket is a Java web application framework that takes simplicity,
> separation of concerns and ease of development to a whole new level.
> Wicket pages can be mocked up, previewed and later revised using
> standard WYSIWYG HTML design tools. Dynamic content processing and
> form handling is all handled in Java code using a first-class
> component model backed by POJO data beans that can easily be persisted
> using your favourite technology.

> Swing-like OO Component Model: Pages and Components in Wicket are real
> Java objects that support encapsulation, inheritance and events.

> Ease of Development: Because Wicket is Java and HTML, you can leverage
> what you know about Java or your favorite HTML editor to write Wicket
> applications.

> Separation of Concerns: Wicket does not mix markup with Java code and
> adds no special syntax to your markup files. The worlds of HTML and
> Java are parallel and associated only by Wicket ids, which are
> attributes in HTML and Component properties in Java. Since Wicket HTML
> is just HTML and Wicket Java is just Java, coders and designers can
> work independently to a large degree and without relying on any
> special tools.

Zur Zeit liegt ein
[Proposal](http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/WicketProposal) vor, dass
vorschlÃ¤gt Wicket als Apache Projekt zu etablieren.
