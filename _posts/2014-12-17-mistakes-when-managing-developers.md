I have worked as a developer and a project manager (and I still do) and I couldn't agree more: Mistakes made when managing developers.

For example:

> Don't assume that software developers will speak up about their challenges, ideas or even triumphs.

> Not allowing developers to work during their most natural productive and undisturbed times.

... and many more.
