From the "KeePass project website":http://keepass.info/ :

bq. "KeePass is a free open source password manager, which helps you to manage your passwords in a secure way. You can put all your passwords in one database, which is locked with one master key or a key file. So you only have to remember one single master password or select the key file to unlock the whole database. The databases are encrypted using the best and most secure encryption algorithms currently known (AES and Twofish)." 

Keepass is a very nice tool for windows. But as I am working more and more on other platforms using different operating systems (i.e. WinXP and Mac OSX) I had o find a solution to access all passwords there. BTW: OSX Keychain is a nice tool but it can't be used on Windows.

As KeePass is a open source software I was glad to discover that KeePass is available in a Linux/OSX version as well a.k.a. "KeePassX":http://keepassx.sourceforge.net/ . Database formats are the same. Which means you can use the same database file on all plattforms. Perfect!
