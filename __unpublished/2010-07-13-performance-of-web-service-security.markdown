# Performance of Web Service Security

It is a well-known fact that security adds significant overhead to the processing of data. Web services are no exception. The publication [“Performance of Web Services Security”](http://grids.ucs.indiana.edu/ptliupages/publications/WSSPerf.pdf) investigates the effects of security / cryptography on the performance of web services.

An interesting  result from the paper is that “WS-SecureConversation is noticeably faster than normal WS-Security as the former doesn’t generate symmetric keys every time”.
