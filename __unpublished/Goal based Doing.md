# Action-based vs. result-based Doing


The problem with action based to do lists is that they just tell you the action you should do.

When looking at them you don't start thinking about 
* the goal
* is it still required
* is there another way to do it
* can you delegate it
* how could you save time doing it differently

Sometimes it is better to write down a goal you want to achieve. Not how to do it. This gives you options how to achieve that goal. It doesn't force you to execute an action but offers the opportunity to find creative solutions.

It will help you finding shortcuts instead of stupidly just following what you wrote down some time ago. It will motivate because you know what will be the outcome.

1. Clarify what the final result is
2. Decide the very next action required to move toward that result
3. Put reminders of the desired result and the next action in a system that you trust
4. Put only things you are committed to in your system, no waste
5. Clean up from time to time
6. Put things you like on your to-do list

Keep a balance between duties and things you enjoy
